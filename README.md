This is my about me website developed to learn about web development for a college class at Raritan Valley Community College.<br>
I designed this website with my favorite color as the background color.<br>
I found a complementary blue to my favorite color with <a href="https://color.adobe.com">Adobe Color</a> to add to other elements on the page and I used the built in color whitesmoke on the website as well.<br>
