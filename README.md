This is my about me website developed to learn about web development for a college class at Raritan Valley Community College.<br>
I designed this website with my favorite color as the background color.<br>
I found a complementary blue to my favorite color with <a href="https://color.adobe.com">Adobe Color</a> to add to other elements on the page and I used the built in CSS color whitesmoke on the website as well.<br><br>
At the top of the page is a nav bar which is collapsable on a mobile screen with a hamburger button.<br>
I used what I learned in my JavaScript class to make the hamburger icon change the page when clicked.<br>
I got the hamburger icon from a royalty free logo website.<br><br>
The next section is the title section. It includes my avatar generated from <a href="https://avataaars.com">avataaars.com</a>.<br>
Below that is my image. I displayed my CSS hover animation skills with smooth transitions here.<br><br>
The next section is my bio. I learned about CSS grid creating this section and added more hover animations for desktop and laptop users.<br><br>
Below that is my hobbies where I wrote an article including another photo with hover animations.<br><br>
Then is my gallery of hobby pictures aligned with CSS grid.<br><br>
