        I like watching all the different kinds of birds that visit our birdfeeder when the weather is nice.<br>
        I also enjoy watching birds on hikes. We live near many trails that are great for seeing wildlife.<br><br>
        I mine various different cryptocurrencies for fun. All I have to do is leave a program running on a gaming PC
        and I earn passive income.<br>
        I also have special purpose machines that can only mine cryptocurrency.<br><br>
        I'm a big fan of cars, car shows, racing, and racing videogames. I like watching Formula 1, Indiecar, and Le
        Mans 24 hour race.<br>
        I also like extreme motorsports like drifting and rallycross.<br>
        I plan on going to Pike's Peak Hill Climb one day because it is one of my favorite races and my family has a
        place in Colorado.<br>
        I like all kinds of cars, from classic muscle cars to exotic supercars, and even trucks like this F150 Shelby
        from a car show in Monument, Colorado.<br><br>
        <img class="f150" width="30%" src="img/f150.jpg" alt="f150" /><br><br>
        I like to play Forza games on PC and Xbox. I enjoy the novelty of their Horizon series and the realism of their
        Motorsport series.<br><br>
        Programming is also a hobby of mine. I like learning new programming languages, expanding my knowledge on ones I
        know, and open sourcing my code.<br>
        Sometimes I get a programming contract with my business <a href="https://njweb.solutions">NJ Web Solutions</a>.

      <h2>Blog of a home crypto miner 2 months post Ethereum mining</h2>
      <div class="blog">
        <p class="dropcap">
          I have been following the cryptocurrency markets for a long time, going back to my high school days in the
          early
          2010s.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020, during the Covid-19 Pandemic, I became interested in cryptocurrency mining after getting a stock tip
          about a cryptocurrency mining stock from my uncle. After some research, I found out that crypto mining stocks
          like MARA and RIOT were skyrocketing, along with the rest of the crypto market.
        </p>
        <p>
          Googling, “how to mine <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> on Windows 10,” lead me to a piece of mining
          software called <a href="https://nicehash.com">NiceHash</a>. I
          started mining on a single gaming PC that I built from old parts with NiceHash software running in the
          background.
        </p>
        <p>
          NiceHash was running both PhoenixMiner and XMRig mining <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> and <a
            href="https://www.getmonero.org">Monero</a> respectively for the people
          renting my hash power. I got some Bitcoin in exchange as payment from NiceHash. The hash power renter paid
          NiceHash Bitcoin for my hash power and some of that was shared with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Ethereum went proof of stake, most of the mining profits dried up.
          This is because Ethereum was paying
          out a vast majority of the daily payments to miners prior to
          <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">the merge</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, instead of miners getting paid newly minted Ethereum for processing transactions, stakers only get
          paid for running nodes they received the privilege of running by staking 32 Ethereum. Miners are left to mine
          other coins, now less profitably.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the height of the mining market, I was renting out my Ethereum and Monero hash power for Bitcoin and
          earning over $30 a day with only three gaming computers. The GPUs were mining Ethereum, and the CPUs were
          mining Monero. Later, I brought on an older GPU with less memory, with which I rented out Ravencoin hash
          power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the way, I added three Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) for mining. Then I brought the
          old GPU offline along with another older GPU and added a new GPU and three new computers. This modernized my
          farm of PCs and I am now running some of the most current hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently mining Neoxa on my GPUs and Monero on my CPUs. I have one ASIC mining <a
            href="https://grin.mw/">Grin</a>, and two ASICs
          mining <a href="https://ethereumclassic.org">Ethereum Classic</a>. I have developed a website to monitor my
          mining stats in real time from the 2Miners
          Mining Pool. This Mining Pool is a resource for miners to pool their hash power together to get shared
          frequent payments instead of individual infrequent payments. The website that I've created to monitor my
          mining stats is <a href="https://blastmining.net">BlastMining.net</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neoxa is a new Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Game cryptocurrency where miners are rewarded for processing
          transactions, and gamers are rewarded for playing on Neoxa game servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Monero and Grin are privacy coins with lots of built in security features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethereum Classic is a Proof-of-Work implementation of Ethereum with a slightly modified algorithm called
          ETCHash.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, <a href="https://kaspa.org/">Kaspa</a> looks like an interesting new cryptocurrency to me. It has
          gotten very popular with miners,
          and you can even rent out your Kaspa hash power for Bitcoin on NiceHash. I don't think I'll be mining Kaspa on
          my GPUs, though, but I do plan on buying a bit of it. I don't plan on mining any Kaspa on my GPUs because
          there are already Fully Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) mining Kaspa with teamredminer and I don't have any
          FPGAs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do have GPUs that Neoxa are perfect for because Neoxa's algorithm is built for GPUs. It rotates algorithms
          while mining to keep ASICs and FPGAs off the network. Ravencoin pioneered that algorithm (kawpow) and Neoxa
          forked it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I look forward to continuing mining in the future and new projects that arise.
