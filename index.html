          I want to be...<br />
          An excellent programmer and web designer<br /><br />

          My favorite way to work is...<br />

        <h2>An excerpt from Dracula</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            "And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we
            must proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of
            Jonathan that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth,
            all of which were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least
            some of these boxes have been removed. It seems to me, that our
            first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the
            house beyond that wall where we look to-day; or whether any more
            have been removed. If the latter, we must trace----"
          </p>

          <p>
            Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house
            came the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was
            shattered with a bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the
            embrasure, struck the far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at
            heart a coward, for I shrieked out. The men all jumped to their
            feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the window and threw up the sash.
            As he did so we heard Mr. Morris's voice without:--
          </p>

          <p>
            "Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you
            about it." A minute later he came in and said:--
          </p>

          <p>
            "It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.
            Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly.
            But the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a
            big bat and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the
            damned brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I
            went out to have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings,
            whenever I have seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art."
          </p>

          <p>"Did you hit it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing.</p>
